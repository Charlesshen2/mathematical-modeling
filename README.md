# mathematical-modeling
I'm going to put some of the usual mathematical modeling models in here  
In the optimization problem of non-convex function optimization, some intelligent optimization algorithms are used.  
For example, particle swarm optimization(PSO), genetic algorithm（GA）, simulated annealing algorithm(SA)
