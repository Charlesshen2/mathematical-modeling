# mathematical-modeling
I'm going to put some of the usual mathematical modeling models in here  
In the optimization problem of non-convex function optimization, some intelligent optimization algorithms are used.  
For example, particle swarm optimization(PSO), genetic algorithm（GA）, simulated annealing algorithm(SA)    
In some of them, the optimization algorithm of sko package is used, some algorithms are instantiated and some parameters are explained.
